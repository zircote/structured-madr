Structured MADR extends the popular [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format with YAML frontmatter,
risk assessments, and audit trails. This guide walks you through adopting it in an existing project.

## Prerequisites

- A project repository (Git recommended)
- A directory for architectural decisions (e.g., `docs/decisions/`)

## Step 1: Get the Template

Download the Structured MADR template directly into your project:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/decisions
curl -o docs/decisions/0001-your-decision.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zircote/structured-madr/main/templates/template.md
```

Alternatively, if you prefer a minimal starting point, use the bare template:

```bash
curl -o docs/decisions/0001-your-decision.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zircote/structured-madr/main/templates/template-bare.md
```

The full template includes placeholder text explaining each section. The bare template provides
just the section headings so you can fill them in from scratch.

## Step 2: Fill in the Frontmatter

Every Structured MADR document starts with a YAML frontmatter block. This metadata is what makes
your ADRs machine-readable. Open the file and replace the placeholders:

```yaml

### Required fields

| Field         | Purpose                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `title`       | Short descriptive title for the decision      |
| `description` | One-sentence summary                          |
| `type`        | Always `"adr"`                                |
| `category`    | Decision category (e.g., architecture, security) |
| `tags`        | Keywords for filtering and search             |
| `status`      | One of: `proposed`, `accepted`, `deprecated`, `superseded` |
| `created`     | Creation date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format          |
| `updated`     | Last update date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format       |
| `author`      | Person or team making the decision            |
| `project`     | Project identifier                            |

### Optional fields

| Field          | Purpose                                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `technologies` | Technologies involved in the decision       |
| `audience`     | Who should read this ADR                    |
| `related`      | Filenames of related ADRs                   |

## Step 3: Document Your Decision

Follow the template sections in order. Each section serves a specific purpose:

1. **Status** -- Mirror the frontmatter status value in prose.
2. **Context** -- Describe the background, problem statement, and current limitations.
3. **Decision Drivers** -- List primary and secondary factors influencing the decision.
4. **Considered Options** -- Document each option with technical characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and a risk assessment.
5. **Decision** -- State the chosen approach clearly and directly.
6. **Consequences** -- Split into positive, negative, and neutral outcomes.
7. **Decision Outcome** -- Summarize results and list mitigations for negative consequences.
8. **Related Decisions** -- Link to other ADRs in your project.
9. **Links** -- External resources and references.

## Step 4: Add the Audit Trail

The audit section is what sets Structured MADR apart for compliance-driven teams.
After implementation, add an audit entry:

```markdown
## Audit

### 2025-02-01

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**

| Finding               | Files              | Lines    | Assessment |
|-----------------------|--------------------|----------|------------|
| PostgreSQL configured | `src/db/config.rs` | L15-L45  | compliant  |

**Summary:** Implementation follows ADR specifications.

**Action Required:** None
```

Each audit entry records:
- The date of the audit
- Whether the implementation is compliant
- Specific findings mapped to files and line numbers
- Any required follow-up actions

## Step 5: Number Your ADRs

Use a consistent numbering scheme. The recommended pattern is:

```
docs/decisions/
  0001-use-postgresql-for-storage.md
  0002-adopt-rest-api-pattern.md
  0003-switch-to-event-sourcing.md
```

Use zero-padded four-digit numbers to keep files sorted correctly.
