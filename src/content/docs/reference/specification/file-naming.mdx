# 5. File Naming

Structured MADR files SHOULD follow the naming convention:

```
{NUMBER}-{slug}.md
```

Or:

```
adr_{NUMBER}.md
```

Where:
- `{NUMBER}` is a zero-padded identifier (e.g., `0001`, `0042`)
- `{slug}` is a URL-friendly version of the title

Examples:
- `0001-use-postgresql-for-primary-storage.md`
- `adr_0001.md`

---

# 6. Validation

A Structured MADR document is valid if:

1. The YAML frontmatter is syntactically valid YAML
2. All required frontmatter fields are present with valid values
3. All required body sections are present
4. The audit section contains at least one entry
5. The document conforms to the JSON Schema in `schemas/structured-madr.schema.json`
