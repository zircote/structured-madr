---

Structured MADR provides two templates to help you get started quickly. Both templates include all required frontmatter fields and body sections.

## Full Template

The full template includes guidance text in each section, explaining what to write and how to structure the content. Use this template when you are new to Structured MADR or want reminders about what each section should contain.

**File:** [`templates/template.md`](https://github.com/zircote/structured-madr/blob/main/templates/template.md)

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "{TITLE}"
description: "{DESCRIPTION}"
type: adr
category: {CATEGORY}
tags:
  - {tag}
status: proposed
created: {DATE}
updated: {DATE}
author: {AUTHOR}
project: {PROJECT}
technologies:
  - {technology}
audience:
  - developers
related:
  - {related_adr}
---
```

### Sections Included

The full template provides placeholder text and guidance for every section:

1. **Status** -- Current decision status
2. **Context** -- Background, problem statement, and current limitations
3. **Decision Drivers** -- Primary and secondary factors influencing the decision
4. **Considered Options** -- Each option with description, characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and a three-dimension risk assessment (Technical, Schedule, Ecosystem)
5. **Decision** -- The chosen approach with implementation details
6. **Consequences** -- Categorized as positive, negative, and neutral
7. **Decision Outcome** -- Summary with mitigations for negative consequences
8. **Related Decisions** -- Links to related ADRs
9. **Links** -- External resources
10. **More Information** -- Date, source, references
11. **Audit** -- Compliance tracking with findings table

### Risk Assessment Format

Each considered option includes a structured risk assessment:

```markdown
**Risk Assessment**:
- **Technical Risk**: {Low|Medium|High}. {Explanation}
- **Schedule Risk**: {Low|Medium|High}. {Explanation}
- **Ecosystem Risk**: {Low|Medium|High}. {Explanation}
```

## Bare Template

The bare template contains only the structural skeleton -- section headings and empty fields -- without guidance text. Use this template when you are comfortable with the format and want a clean starting point.

**File:** [`templates/template-bare.md`](https://github.com/zircote/structured-madr/blob/main/templates/template-bare.md)

### What Is Included

- Empty YAML frontmatter with all required fields
- All section headings in the correct order
- Empty risk assessment structure for two options
- Empty audit findings table

### What Is Omitted

- Guidance text explaining each section
- Example values and placeholder descriptions
- Instructional comments
