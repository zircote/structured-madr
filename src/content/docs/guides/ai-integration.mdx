Structured MADR was designed with AI tooling in mind. The YAML frontmatter provides
machine-readable metadata that AI coding assistants can parse, filter, and reason about
without scanning full document prose.

## How Frontmatter Enables AI Tools

Traditional ADRs store all information in unstructured prose. An AI tool must read the
entire document to determine basic facts like status, technologies, or relationships.
Structured MADR solves this with typed frontmatter fields:

| Capability                  | Frontmatter Field          |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Filter relevant decisions   | `tags`, `category`          |
| Understand relationships    | `related`                   |
| Track freshness             | `created`, `updated`        |
| Scope by context            | `project`, `category`       |
| Surface by technology       | `technologies`              |
| Identify audience           | `audience`                  |
| Check decision status       | `status`                    |

An AI assistant can scan frontmatter across dozens of ADRs in milliseconds, then read the
full body only for the relevant documents.

## Integration Patterns

### Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) can reference your ADRs
as project context. With Structured MADR, Claude can efficiently filter decisions by
technology, status, or project.

**Recommended setup**: Add an instruction in your `CLAUDE.md` that points to your ADR directory:

```markdown
## Architecture Decisions

ADRs are stored in `docs/decisions/` using the Structured MADR format.
Before proposing architectural changes, check existing ADRs for relevant context.
Filter by the `technologies` and `tags` frontmatter fields to find related decisions.
```

Claude Code can then:
- Search ADRs by `technologies` field to find decisions about specific tools
- Check `status` to know which decisions are active vs. deprecated
- Follow `related` links to understand decision chains
- Read audit sections to verify implementation compliance

### ADR Plugin for Claude Code

The [ADR Plugin for Claude Code](https://github.com/zircote/marketplace/tree/main/plugins/adr)
provides full lifecycle management of Structured MADR documents:

- Create new ADRs from templates
- Search and filter existing decisions
- Update status and audit entries
- Validate documents against the schema

Install the plugin to give Claude Code native commands for ADR management.

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot can use your ADRs as context when suggesting code. Structured frontmatter
helps Copilot understand which decisions apply to the file being edited.

**Tips for Copilot integration**:
- Keep ADRs in a well-known directory (`docs/decisions/`)
- Use descriptive `tags` and `technologies` values that match your codebase terminology
- Ensure `status` is current so Copilot does not reference deprecated decisions

### Cursor

[Cursor](https://cursor.com) indexes project files for its AI features. Structured MADR
frontmatter improves Cursor's ability to surface relevant decisions.

**Recommended setup**: Add your ADR directory to Cursor's context with a `.cursorrules` file:

```
When making architectural decisions, reference existing ADRs in docs/decisions/.
ADRs use Structured MADR format with YAML frontmatter containing status, tags,
technologies, and related fields.
```

## Optimizing Your ADRs for AI Consumption

### Use specific, consistent tags

Tags are the primary filter mechanism for AI tools. Use consistent terminology:

```yaml
# Good -- specific and consistent
tags:
  - authentication
  - oauth2
  - identity-provider

# Avoid -- vague and inconsistent
tags:
  - auth
  - security stuff
```

### Keep the technologies field accurate

List all technologies evaluated, not just the chosen one. This ensures the ADR surfaces
when an AI tool searches for any of the evaluated options:

```yaml
technologies:
  - postgresql
  - mysql
  - mongodb
```

### Maintain the related field

Explicit relationships help AI tools build a graph of connected decisions:

```yaml
related:
  - 0001-select-primary-database.md
  - 0003-caching-strategy.md
```

Without `related`, AI tools must infer connections from prose, which is slower and less reliable.

### Update status promptly

An outdated `status` field causes AI tools to recommend deprecated approaches:

| Status       | AI behavior                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `proposed`   | May suggest alternatives or improvements       |
| `accepted`   | References as current guidance                 |
| `deprecated` | Warns against following this approach          |
| `superseded` | Points to the replacement decision             |

### Write clear descriptions

The `description` field is a one-sentence summary that AI tools use for quick triage:

```yaml
# Good -- specific and actionable
description: "Adopt PostgreSQL over MySQL for JSONB support and advanced indexing."

# Avoid -- too vague
description: "Database decision."
```

## Querying ADRs Programmatically

Because frontmatter is valid YAML, you can query it with standard tools:

```bash
# Find all accepted ADRs about authentication
grep -l "status: accepted" docs/decisions/*.md | \
  xargs grep -l "authentication"

# List all technologies across ADRs
grep "^  - " docs/decisions/*.md | \
  sed -n '/^.*technologies:/,/^[^ ]/p'
```

AI tools perform similar queries internally. The more consistent your frontmatter,
the more accurately tools can filter and surface relevant decisions.
