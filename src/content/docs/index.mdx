Structured MADR is an extension of [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) (Markdown Architectural Decision Records) that adds YAML frontmatter for machine-readable metadata, comprehensive option analysis with risk assessments, and required audit sections for compliance tracking.

## Why Structured MADR?

Traditional ADR formats were designed for human readers. While they capture decisions effectively, they lack machine-readable metadata for programmatic access, structured risk assessment for option evaluation, audit trails for compliance verification, and explicit relationships between decisions.

Structured MADR addresses these gaps while remaining fully human-readable and compatible with existing ADR workflows.
